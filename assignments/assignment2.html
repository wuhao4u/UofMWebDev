  <p><strong>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times</strong>, it was the age of wisdom,<br>
    it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,<br>
    it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, <br>
    it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, <br>
    we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way â€“ in short, <br>
    the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, <br>
    for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.</p>
